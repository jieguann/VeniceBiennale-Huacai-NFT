#  ODE XR

Experience a mystic encounter with metaphysical beings in AR, join this artistic journey to imagine the potential dialogues between physical and virtual existence. A mixed-reality experience containing two virtual artworks: "ODE" and "Immutable", exhibiting as part of the 59th Venice Art Biennale exhibition: The Road of Faith. 



## ODE:

An ode to the amour of humans and beyond, between physical and virtual state of being.

Painted and visualized by AI, based on an ancient romance imagined and written by human, transcribed into language perceivable to machine, to hallucinate this dreamy encounter between a man and a goddess, a disparate match destined to part ways...

An entanglement between realities and dreams, the physical body and the metaphysical being, the limits of life and infinity of the spirit, an ode to the love of humans and all possibilities we share beyond...

## Immutable:

Through the perspective of AR, we are able to imagine virtual possibilities in physical space, to explore the boundaries of our perceptible reality. In "Immutable", is the virtual possibility of motion and how it exceed beyond the physical bounds of our visual perception.

This piece manifests an atemporal flux of quantum orbital motion. Orbiting in a frequency so fast that far supersedes both our eyes limit to perceive or the refresh rate of the device screen, and hence seeing it as almost motionless.


![ROOM B 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60975534/183159586-ba8e9816-2e59-4370-a8ae-7a0973fd0df1.png)

When the AR viewer is close enough, the orbit will no longer leave any trace of motion, rather would become so fast to seem completely motionless, yet everywhere at once.
